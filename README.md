# Welcome to my GitHub

I recently graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Biochemistry and I am highly motivated to pursue a career in Bioinformatics. To explore this interest, I completed my Bachelor's degree project on the state-of-the-art advancements in de novo genome assembly. I'm planning to further deepen my knowledge by pursuing a Master's degree in Bioinformatics.

Beyond academics, I bring a strong work ethic and a collaborative spirit honed through my experience as an international football goalkeeper for the Portuguese National Team. I'm also an enthusiastic gamer, which fuels my analytical and problem-solving skills.

This Master's degreee is going to be a treacherous journey, but I will prevail.
